This is a project spearheaded by Sean Jordan and Nathan McEwen during October 2015. This was concieved and built during a two-day hackathon and recieved top team honors. Primarily this was a proof of concept showing that real time tracking and updates were possible in a visual interface with as low power as a cellphone and as basic an interpretter as javascript. 

Basically this is a website that takes a location and diplays all injected entities on a a video passthrough display as the user looks around increasing situational awareness for items that may be behind a wall or other obstruction.

The mathmatics involved are not inconsequential and thanks go to Nathan for the serious contribution he made to this project. All the conversion for location of the target from geocoordinates compared to local position are thanks to him and his crazy math skills.

During the hackathon there was time to mock the system up for demonstration but not to fully develop the work. It was designed with a Surface Pro 3 display using HTML5 video and javascript to properly display the images around the field view if the compass is calibrated properly, which turned out to be a challenge on mobile devices as we discovered the compass was frequently out of calibration. This is a rough product but demonstrates the ability to solve problems rapidly and cheaply exists even if it isn't perfect knowing the possible drives better efforts.
